ALX Backend Storage
Overview
Welcome to the alx-backend-storage repository! This project is part of the ALX Backend Short Specialization curriculum. The focus of this repository is on various storage solutions, including Advanced MySQL and NoSQL.


Introduction
In this project, we explore different storage solutions and their integration with backend systems. We dive into relational databases with Advanced MySQL, non-relational databases with NoSQL, and in-memory data structure stores with Redis. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data in various backend applications.
